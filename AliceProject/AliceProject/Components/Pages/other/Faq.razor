        <MudExpansionPanel Text="How do I upload student files?">
            <MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
                You can upload student files either individually using the file selector (only .cs files are accepted),
                or by uploading a ZIP file exported from Canvas LMS. The ZIP must follow the naming convention and contain only .cs files.
            </MudText>
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="What file types are supported?">
            <MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
                Currently, only C# source files (.cs) are supported. Input/output files for test cases must be in plain text format (.txt).
            </MudText>
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="Can I upload multiple files at once?">
            <MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
                Yes. You can select multiple .cs files for upload, and the system will associate each with a Neptun code.
                You can also upload all at once using the ZIP method.
            </MudText>
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="What is a test case and how do I create one?">
            <MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
                A test case consists of an input file and an expected output file. When a student’s program runs,
                it will receive the input and its output will be compared with the expected output.
                You can create test cases by specifying these files manually under the Tests section.
            </MudText>
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="Why is my program marked as failed even though it seems correct?">
            <MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
                The comparison is strict and based on exact content. Extra spaces, new lines, or differences in output format
                can cause a test to fail. Always match the expected format exactly.
            </MudText>
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="What does the 'Unknown' status in test results mean?">
            <MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
                It means the test case hasn’t been run yet for the selected program file. Run a specific test or all tests to get results.
            </MudText>
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="Can I delete or edit uploaded files and test cases?">
            <MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
                Yes. Uploaded files and test cases can be deleted or re-uploaded. Just click the corresponding delete or update icons.
            </MudText>
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="Is the platform mobile-friendly?">
            <MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
                Absolutely. The layout is fully responsive, and all features are accessible on smaller screens via adaptive design.
            </MudText>
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="What happens when I log out?">
            <MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
                Logging out deletes your authentication token. You will need to re-enter your credentials to log back in.
            </MudText>
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="How long does the login session last?">
            <MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
                Sessions last for 30 minutes by default, even if the browser is restarted. After that, you'll be automatically logged out.
            </MudText>
        </MudExpansionPanel>

        <MudExpansionPanel Text="How can I change my password?">
            <MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
                Go to your Profile page and enter your current and new passwords. You'll need to confirm the new password twice.
